A Snake Game using OpenCV in Python utilizes computer vision to control the snake with hand gestures or object tracking. By integrating MediaPipe or OpenCV's color tracking, players navigate the snake without a keyboard. The game logic runs with Pygame or custom OpenCV drawing functions, offering an interactive, AI-enhanced gaming experience. Perfect for vision-based control experiments!
